# Data-Science-Assignment

The eCommerce Transactions dataset was analyzed and modeled to derive actionable insights, build predictive models, and segment customers effectively. The assignment involved three key tasks: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), developing a Lookalike Model, and performing Customer Segmentation using clustering techniques. EDA revealed critical insights such as customer distribution across regions, top-performing product categories, seasonal trends in sales and signups, and the significant revenue contribution of high-value customers. These findings enable better-targeted marketing and operational strategies to boost growth in underrepresented regions and during low-performing periods.

In the Lookalike Model, a cosine similarity-based approach was used to recommend the top three similar customers for the first 20 customers based on transaction history and profiles, providing valuable tools for personalized marketing. The Customer Segmentation task employed K-Means Clustering, identifying four customer groups with distinct behaviors. Metrics like the Davies-Bouldin Index validated the clustering quality, and actionable strategies were suggested for each segment to enhance engagement and revenue. Overall, this assignment demonstrated the application of data science techniques in extracting meaningful business insights, improving customer understanding, and enabling data-driven decision-making for eCommerce optimization.
